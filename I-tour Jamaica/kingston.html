                        <p style="text-align:left;">
                            Its name is understood to have originally been King's Town, and eventually shortened to Kingston. Although it is the smallest parish, it is the largest city in Jamaica, with a population of 89,057 in metropolitan Kingston.
                            Many businesses, government offices, and schools are headquartered here and it is a vital centre for sports and entertainment as well.

                        <img src="image/e_park.jpg">
                        <p>
                            Emancipation Park is located about 30-minutes drive from the Norman Manley International Airport. It is directly across the street from the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel, and just minutes away from the Jamaica Hilton and other hotel accommodations.
                            Art enthusiasts will appreciate at the 11ft. Bronze sculpture created by acclaimed Jamaican artist, Laura Facey. Those with an eye for detail may notice the West African Adinkras (Spiritual Symbols) which are interwoven throughout the parks decor.


                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nature lovers will be delighted by the amazing tropical flowers and plants, which provide various punches of color throughout the park. Red Geraniums compliment Yellow Lantana and contrast beautifully against the Pink and Peach Roses found in well-maintained flowerbeds strewn throughout the park.
                            Jamaican National Lignum Vitae trees and Tree of Life flowering plants also dot the environment, simultaneously beautifying, providing shade and channeling the light breeze throughout the park.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The center of the park features an expansive but not obtrusive stage with modern facilities for live entertainment. On Emancipation night, this stage comes alive with the best of Jamaican folk and local musical artists.
                            On any given day, you will find people playing chess or ping pong on the built in tables. There are also various aerobics classes taking place on the well-manicured lawn.
